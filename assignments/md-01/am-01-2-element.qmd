title: "Communication in a chat"
---

Emails are not a very quick, responsive way of communication. We avoid them by prioritising other channels.

We want to communicate through a chat client called Element, providing the open source, free-of-charge Slack-like experience.

On Element, you can reach out to the course instructors and other students any time, and we have a way to stay in touch beyond the course itself.
