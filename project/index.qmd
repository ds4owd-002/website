## {{< fa code >}} GitHub repository

Establishing the GitHub repository with self-identified data was part of the homework assignment of module 5, 6, and 7. 

- [Module 5 - Assignment 1](../assignments/md-05/am-05-1-project-data.qmd): Identify data for your capstone project
- [Module 7 - Assignment 2](../assignments/md-07/am-07-2-project-metadata.qmd): Get going with your capstone project

It is important that these two assignments are completed before continuing with the write up of the report as outlined on this page.
