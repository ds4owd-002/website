Except your username. You might want to give that some thought.\nA few tips, which sadly tend to contradict each other:\n\nIncorporate your actual name! People like to know who they’re dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.\nReuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack. But, of course, someone with no GitHub activity will probably be squatting on that.\nPick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.\nShorter is better than longer.\nBe as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some settings GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames.\nMake it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence, e.g. JennyFromTheBlock.\nAvoid words laden with special meaning in programming.\nAvoid the use of upper vs. lower case to separate words. We highly recommend all lowercase. GitHub treats usernames in a case insensitive way, but using all lowercase is kinder to people doing downstream regular expression work with usernames, in various languages. A better strategy for word separation is to use a hyphen -.\n\nYou can change your username later, but better to get this right the first time.\n\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/changing-your-github-username/\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/what-happens-when-i-change-my-username/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Register for an ORCID iD\n\nCreate your ORCID iD at: https://orcid.org/register\n\nLearn more about ORCID and why you should get one, even if your are not a researcher or working in academia.\n\n\n Step 3: Fill out our registration form\n\nFill out this form: https://forms.gle/MP5rNYZagBdfG2ZRA\n\n\n\n Step 4: Register for the scheduled Zoom meetings\n\nRegister here: New link to be provided"

You find yourself within an environment for (scientific) computing. R is a programming language for scientific computing and the additionally taught tools (e.g. Quarto) and workflows (version control) to combine R in a writing and publishing workflow. We also briefly touch on some data management topics (Data Organisation in Spreadsheet) without getting into much detail about file management.\nThe following paper provides recommendations for some of the practices we use in class and puts them into the context of organising your data analysis work. That can be research and academic work, but is just as relevant if you are a consultant, working for an NGO, government, and others.\nFor this assignment, we ask you to:\n\nRead Wilson et al. (2017): “Good enough practices in scientific computing”.\nChose one of the recommended practices (Data Management, Software, Collaboration, Project organization, Keeping track of changes, Manuscripts), then:\nCome up with a real-world example or scenario where the recommended practice could be applied in your research or academic work.\nBe prepared to explain how the recommended practices would improve your workflows. This will be in the class setting as part of small discussion group (max 3 people).\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nWilson, Greg, Jennifer Bryan, Karen Cranston, Justin Kitzes, Lex Nederbragt, and Tracy K.
